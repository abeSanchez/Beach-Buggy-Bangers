# February 25th, 2019

## ME ICD Inception Meeting
- CS team plans on creating a single module to be used by each of the 3 ME teams' buggies
    - ME teams worry about how testing on their side will go using this approach
- Have ICD created by first week of April
    - Specify dimensions, weight and location of our module on buggy
- Setting up a Google doc / Sharepoint for all to share docs
    - Discord channels could suffice for this

## TA Check-in 1

## Questions we have
